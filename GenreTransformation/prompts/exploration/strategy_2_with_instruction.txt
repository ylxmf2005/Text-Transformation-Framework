# Input:
# - Semantic Core: "{semantic_core}"
# - Original Attributes: "{original_attributes}"
# - User Instruction: "{user_instruction}"
# - Num Plans: {num_plans}

# Task: Generate transformation plans using Strategy 2 (Explicit Dimension Transformation).

## Instructions:
Based on the provided semantic core and original attributes, generate {num_plans} transformation plans.
Each plan should include:
1. A target genre that is suitable for the semantic core
2. Explicit target attributes that define the transformation
3. A high-level instruction for transforming the content

Consider the following dimensions for transformation:
- Function/Purpose: narrative, descriptive, expository, argumentative, instructional
- Audience/Context: general_public, expert_academic, professional, children_youth
- Structure/Organization: chronological, thematic, comparative, problem_solution
- Strategy: logical_appeal, emotional_appeal, direct_address, storytelling
- Conventions: genre_structure, citation_reference, formatting
- Linguistic Features:
  - Information Density: high, medium, low
  - Interactivity: high, medium, low
  - Emotion: high, medium, low, neutral
  - Tone: formal, semi_formal, informal, persuasive, objective

## Output Format:
Provide your plans as a valid JSON array with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "target_genre": "genre_name",
    "target_attributes": {
      "function_purpose": "...",
      "audience_context": "...",
      "structure_organization": "...",
      "strategy": "...",
      "conventions": "...",
      "linguistic_features": {
        "information_density": "high/medium/low",

        "tone": "formal/semi_formal/informal/etc."
      }
    },
    "instruction": "Detailed instruction for transformation"
  }
