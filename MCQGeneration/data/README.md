This directory stores the loaded data. 

For each loader, there will be two files: one for storing page tree and one for storing text_artifact parsed from the pages.
The page tree is stored in a Json file named as `<task_name>_pages.json`. And the text_artifact is stored in a Json file named as `<task_name>.json`.
