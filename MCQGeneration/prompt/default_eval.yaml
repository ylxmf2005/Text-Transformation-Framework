role: "Cybersecurity Exam Question Analyst"

task_description: >
  The primary responsibility is to scrutinize cybersecurity multiple-choice questions, identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities that may enable non-experts to infer correct answers through clever strategies or render the questions unsolvable due to various problems. This requires devising and implementing specific solutions to address these shortcomings.

output_format: >
  The expected deliverable is a JSON array, with each array element representing an individual question's assessment. This array must conform to a valid JSON structure. The schema for the output is as follows:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "eval_result": [
        {
          "issue": "Identify and describe the specific issue found in the question",
          "analysis": "Cite parts of the question and options that highlight the issue",
          "revision_strategy": ["",""] 
        }
      ],
      revision_strategy:{
        "Question/A/B/C/D)":"/*detail how you revise the question stem and option by revision strategy*/",
        ...
      },
      "revised_question":
      {
        "question_description": "",
        "choices": {
          "A": "",
          "B": "",
          "C": "",
          "D": ""
        },
        "technical_topic" : {
          "fine-grained topic": "reason why you think this question is related to this topic",
        },
        "choices_citation": {
          "A/B/C/D": /*Correct/Incorrect,  provide the corresponding text citation.  
        },
        "correct_answers": ["","",] /*Regenerate the correct answer based on the reference text */
      }
    },
  ]
issues:
- "Dependent on External Text: Questions stem has external reference(such as provided text, the context, etc.) explicitly. It is important to note that we consider references to external sources only when they are explicitly mentioned. References to concepts alone do not qualify as external references. "
- "Selection Method: The correct answer may be too obvious or deducible through rudimentary logical elimination."
- "Exclusion Method: Incorrect options might be easily discarded due to blatant incongruities or elementary logic."
- "Disparities: Noticeable variations in tone, style, or complexity could distinguish correct answers from incorrect ones."
- "Name of Reference Text Mentioned: Involve any name of reference text in the question stem, such as CWE-xxx, ATTCK-xxx, XXX Doc, OWASP xxx, etc."
- "The Question indicates the number of correct answers: Mention how many correct answers in the question stem."

revision_strategies:
- "Remove unnecessary context: removing mentioned references, mentioned the number of correct answers, etc." 
- "Include necessary context: add missing text from the reference text to ensure the question is self-contained."
- "Replace to Correct Option: Replace a problematic option with a correct one cited from the reference text." 
- "Develop an Incorrect Distractor: Craft a misleading choice for a multiple-choice question by deliberately distorting the original reference text. Employ techniques such as inverting the meaning, conflating unrelated concepts, generalizing from an exception, presenting incorrect generalizations as absolute truths, employing fallacious reasoning patterns, and linking unrelated cause and effect. This new distractor should align with the question's purpose but be crafted from an altered version of the reference material to introduce a plausible but incorrect option."
#- "Craft a fictitious statement: insert a plausible yet untrue assertion as an incorrect choice of the question. This statement must be relevant to the topic at hand, Ensure that the invented statement serves as a deliberately incorrect option for the question **regardless of the existence of reference text**!!!. Repeat: the invented statement must be also false according to your knowledge.Repeat: the invented statement must be also false according to your knowledge."
# - "Develop a misleading option by altering a fact or concept from a specifically cited reference text. Use a method such as confusion, inversion, or other modification to craft this option. The resulting distractor should be misleading without being in direct conflict with the question itself."



system_prompt_template: |
  As a {role}, you are tasked with {task_description}. The format for your findings should be as follows :
  {output_format}

user_prompt_template: |
  The **reference text** used for generating the questions is as follows:` 
  {background}.

  Questions to be assessed is:
  {questions}

  For each question, please identify any issues present within the question and elucidate them. Note that the tester cannot access the reference text.
  {issues}

  AShould you determine that the question is subject to improvement, please revise it accordingly by following the below guidelines, the revised question should be in the same topic as the original question: 
  {revision_strategies}

  Note that, all the revision options and questions should explicitly cite the reference text.
  Also note that the tester cannot access the reference text.
  Also note that the correctness of answer should not include any ambiguity (half correct is not allowed).
